# A Whale off the Port(folio) Project

## Overview
In this project, we evaluate the performance of various portfolios that include algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios, and compare them against the S&P 500 Index, a commonly used benchmark index in the financial industry. The project allows us to apply the knowledge and skills we've gained in financial performance measurement, risk management, and portfolio management.

## Objectives
- Understand the daily returns of each portfolio and the S&P 500 Index.
- Analyze the risk of each portfolio.
Identify and interpret key risk and return metrics like the Sharpe Ratios.
- Compare these portfolios against the S&P 500 Index to identify which portfolio outperforms the market.

## Tools Used
- Python: The project is entirely coded in Python, making use of powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib, hvPlot: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Jupyter Notebook: The code and analysis are presented in a Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.


## Project Structure
The project is structured in the following way:
- Data Cleaning and Processing: We start by importing and cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis.
Performance Analysis: We calculate and visualize daily returns, cumulative returns for each portfolio and the S&P 500.
- Risk Analysis: We calculate and visualize key risk metrics for each portfolio.
- Risk-Return Analysis: We calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios of the portfolios to understand their risk-adjusted returns.

## Portfolio Comparisons: 
- Finally, we compare the portfolios against the S&P 500 Index to find the portfolio that outperforms the market.

## Getting Started
- Clone the project repository.
- Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed (pandas, matplotlib, hvplot, Jupyter).
- Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook to view the project files.

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis of various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios against the S&P 500. It gives us valuable insights into their performance, risk, and risk-adjusted returns, helping us make better investment decisions.
